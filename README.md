* `addPlayer()`: This function is triggered when the user clicks the "Add Player" button. The function adds the player's information to the leaderboard and updates the leaderboard.
* `validateInput()`: This function validates the user input. The function checks to make sure that all of the fields are filled out and that the player score is a number.
* `showError()`: This function shows an error message to the user. The function is called if the user input is invalid.
